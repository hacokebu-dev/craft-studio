## The Spark

It came to me all of a sudden. I suddenly realized I needed a dedicated space to showcase my work. I’d always told myself, "I'll build a website eventually," but "eventually" never had a date. As soon as the thought struck, I decided: I’m doing this right now.

As a designer at my core, my mind immediately jumped to the visual concept. I wanted something bold yet minimalist. But then the overthinking started. What exactly am I showcasing? How should I do it? I even hesitated, thinking, "Should I create the assets myself, or will AI produce something better anyway?"

Then came the Aha moment. I realized I shouldn’t be stressing over the design yet—I needed to focus on the content. My logical brain said, "Create the work first, then build the site." But my heart said, "Build the site first." I knew that once the stage was set, I’d be even more motivated to fill it with great work.

## Finding Meaning

Even without a finished portfolio, I started organizing the content. Writing the headline for the Hero section helped me define exactly what I do. I clarified the meaning behind the unique name 'HACO&KEBU,' the values I stand for, and what I want to achieve in the future.

## Bold by Design

When I returned to the design, I doubled down on the "bold" theme. (Maybe because I don’t get to be this daring at my day job!) I went with oversized fonts and a striking color palette: Black, Ivory, and Red.

I did worry a bit about readability—long stretches of ivory text on a black background isn't always the most comfortable experience. But since the contrast passed accessibility standards and I wasn't in the mood to design a separate "Light Mode," I decided to stick to my guns. I mocked up about five core pages in Figma, trusting that AI could handle the rest, like the 404 and empty states.

## Enter Lovable

Then came the technical side. I initially thought of using Gatsby, but heard Astro is the way to go these days. While looking into Astro, I had a thought: "Why not just build it myself with an AI agent?"

As luck would have it, I got a chance to try the PRO plan of a service called Lovable. I already subscribe to several AI tools, and it made me laugh at myself—I’m the type of person who leaves unread books on the shelf but rushes to borrow new ones from the library. My curiosity won, and the project began.

## Working with an AI Agent

I fed my Figma designs and detailed specs into Lovable. I asked for everything: multi-language support (i18n), Unicorn Studio scripts for the Hero section, a Markdown-based portfolio and blog, and full responsiveness. The first draft looked okay, but it wasn't quite at the design level I expected, so I had to roll up my sleeves.

Lovable has a cool feature called 'Visual Edits' where you can click an element and prompt a change. To be honest, it was a bit frustrating, so I ended up giving specific instructions by checking the class names myself.

However, the communication was great. it understood me surprisingly well. it understood me perfectly. One of the best parts was the local environment sync—pushing code from my machine to Lovable and vice versa was smooth.

## The Logo

I couldn't launch without a logo. I knew I wanted a drum motif. In Korea, there’s an expression that translates roughly to “playing both the drum and the janggu(traditional Korean double-headed drum) alone,” which basically means being a one-man show. That’s exactly how I felt.

I experimented with several drum-inspired designs and refined them into the current logo. Is it perfect? Maybe not yet. I’ll live with it for a while; if it grows on me, I’ll keep it. If not, I’ll go back to the drawing board.
&nbsp;

&nbsp; 

## Wrapping Up

By choosing to build the website first, I was forced to define my logo, my values, and my brand all at once. Now that the house is built, it's time to fill it with great work. Stay tuned!
