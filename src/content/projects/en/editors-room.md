Leading the 'Editors Room' web development team or representing it as a new member, I believe in a structure where everyone has a strong sense of ownership, taking initiative in their work and delivering results. Just like every individual is the CEO of their own role.

So how can a company systematically create an environment where each team member has a powerful sense of ownership? There's a concept called DRI (Directly Responsible Individual). This term was coined by Apple. Steve Jobs wrote the DRI concept to clarify who is responsible for each task. Jobs created this concept because of a question that arose.

"When executing strategy A in the marketing team, the results were worse than expected. Was it the final decision-maker, the team leader who approved the decision, that was wrong? Or was the strategy itself that the team developed flawed?"

Jobs looked at it this way:

"No, the final decision-maker in marketing is the person who knows marketing best, so why is someone who doesn't even know about marketing making the final marketing decision just because they're in a higher position?"

From then on, Jobs designed Apple so that the most specialized person in each specific task would be the manager and spread the DRI decision-making framework throughout the company.
